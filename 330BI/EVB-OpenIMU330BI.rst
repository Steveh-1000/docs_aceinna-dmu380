    **3.4 IMU interface type selection header (P1).**

	**Pins 1-2** define IMU **Interface Mode**:
	
	|  If there is no connection between pins 1 and 2 (jumper is OFF) - **SPI** mode. 
	|  if there is connection between pins 1 and 2 (jumper is ON) - **UART** mode (default). 
	
	**In SPI mode:**
	
	|  **Jumpers between pins 3-4 and 5-6 need to be taken OFF** to prevent interference 
	   between SPI bus signals (SS and MISO) and serial interface signals 
	   from FTDI chip. 
	|  IMU SPI interface signals (MISO, MOSI, SS, SCK, DRDY)
	   routed to header P4.

.. note::
	On **SPI** interface IMU acts as a **SLAVE** device.  
..    

.. note::
    Not all provided application examples support SPI interface mode.
    Please refer to specific example for details.	
..

	**In UART mode:**
	
	|  Jumper between pins **3-4** should be **"ON"** (default) if IMU **Serial Channel 0** ( USER main channel ) needs to be routed to PC via USB connection (on first in the row enumerated USB virtual COM port. See p.6).
   	
	|  Jumper between pins **3-4** should be **OFF** if IMU **Serial Channel 0** needs to be accessed from P2 connector.
	

    **3.5 IMU Serial Debug Channel mode selection header (P2).**

	|  Jumpers between pins **1-2 and 3-4** should be **ON** if IMU **Debug Serial** needs to be routed to PC via USB 
	   connection, for example in case of using IMU Debug Serial Channel for streaming out debug information to PC 
	   or as CLI interface (on third in the row enumerated USB virtual COM port. See p.6).
	   
	|  Jumpers between pins **1-2 and 3-4** should be **OFF** if IMU **Debug Serial Channel** needs to be routed to some external 
	   device (for example GPS). In this case **pin 2 is RX** (to IMU) and **pin 4 is TX** (from IMU). 

    **3.6 SWD (JTAG) connector (P3).**

    20-pin connector P3 used for connecting ST-Link or J-Link debuggers to the IMU for
    in-system debugging of applications via SWD interface. It has standard pin-out.

    **3.7 USB connector (J3)**

    USB connector used for powering up the IMU and evaluation board. Also its used to providing connectivity
    from PC to IMU via virtual serial ports. Up to 3 exposed IMU serial interfaces can be routed to PC.


**4. OpenIMU evaluation board LED indicators**

    Evaluation board has few LED indicators for visual monitoring of data traffic on serial ports:

    **LED2** indicator reflects activity on RX line of IMU main (user) serial interface (traffic to IMU)

    **LED1** indicator reflects activity on TX line of IMU main (user) serial interface (traffic from IMU)

    **LED3** indicator while lit indicates presence of the power (in case switch SW1 is "ON")

    **LED4** indicator reflects activity on GPIO3 (lit if high)

    **LED5** indicator reflects activity on GPIO2 (lit if high)


**5. Open IMU evaluation board power**

    Power to OpenIMU evaluation board provided by USB.
    To power system up - connect USB cable to connector J1 and turn "ON" switch SW1.

**6. Communication with IMU from PC**

    |  The OpenIMU evaluation board has an FTDI chip FT4232 installed. This chip provides 4 virtual serial ports.
       When evaluation board set up to force IMU interface in UART mode (see p.3.4) up to 3 serial ports on IMU can communicate with PC.
       When evaluation board connected to PC and power switch turned "ON" in Device Manager board will appear as **4 new consecutive virtual COM ports**.
	
	|  First in a row virtual port is routed to IMU's main UART channel (Serial channel 0) (pins 3 and 4 on J2), and usually dedicated for sending commands 
	   to IMU and capturing responses and periodic messages from IMU. It usually used by python driver to establish communication between IMU and Aceinna Navigation Studio. 
	
	|  Third in a row virtual port routed to IMU's Debug Serial Channel (pins 17 and 19 on J2) and usually used as a debug/CLI serial channel .
